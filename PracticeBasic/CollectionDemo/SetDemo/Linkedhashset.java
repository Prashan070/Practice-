    /*LinkedHashSet internally uses a LinkedHashMap, which combines a hash table and a doubly linked list.
    When we add an element, the hash code is calculated and used to find the bucket.
    If the element is not already present (checked by .equals()), itâ€™s added.
    Meanwhile, the doubly linked list ensures that each element is linked to the previous and next, so that the insertion order is preserved during iteration.
